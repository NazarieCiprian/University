# Databases lab5 assignment
Create CRUD operations for at least 5 of the tables from your database (must
include at least one many-to-many relation). They must be encapsulated in stored
procedures.
Must use:
 * Input /output parameters
 * Functions (for example for formatting / validating input data)
 * Table/ column constraints to ensure database validity (if needed, according
to your business rules)
Also, create at least 2 views over the tables selected for the CRUD operations. The
views must meet some real business requirements or to test the operations
implemented above.
For the tables used in the views create non-clustered indexes. Make sure the
indexes are helpful by checking the index usage with Dynamic Management Views;
if not, you need to reconsider indexes or to populate your tables with more data.
