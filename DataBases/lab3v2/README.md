# Databases lab 3 assignment
Write SQL scripts that will (you can generate them but still need to be able to
explain their structure):
· modify the type of a column
· add a default constraint
· create/remove a new table
· add a column
· create/remove a foreign key constraint
For each of the scripts above write/generate another that reverts the operation.
Create a new table that holds the current version of the database schema. Assume
for now the version is a single number.
Put each of the scripts in a stored procedure. Make sure that the naming
convention is simple and clear.
Write another stored procedure that receives as a parameter a version and gets
the database to that version.
